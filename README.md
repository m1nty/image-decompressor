## Image Decompression

### Objective

The main objective of the project is to understand the hardware implementation of several types of digital signal processing algorithms. In addition, the hardware design and implementation must meet some latency constraints (defined indirectly through multiplier utilization constraints), while ensuring that hardware resources are not wasted.
